# hello-world
Still learning!!!

I'm a student trying to learn some coding a little, and I probably won't add much up here. But... you never know. 
I like Bash and scripting, I'm about to start a big college course, and eventually find a good job, hopefully. 

I'm sort of shy, and introverted, but give me a chance, and I'll make sure not to disappoint!
I'm love learning, I love Linux, and I love computer security!

Oh and I apparently have Asperger's Syndrome. I don't really believe it, but I sure seem to have a great memory, great work ethics, and an incorruptible sense of morals.

Nice to meet you!
